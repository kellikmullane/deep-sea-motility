# Compounding Deep Sea Physical Impacts on Marine Microbial Motility

Code in R for the wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualization of experimental data assessing the impact of temperature and pressure on the motility of marine bacteria. 

## Description

This repository includes code to perform data/statistical analysis and plot data to recreate figures seen in the above publication. Code is organized by the experiment/figure it coressponds to (e.g., Fig2_Growth_Rate_Expansion_Speed.R analyzes the growth rate and expansion speed data, then plots it as a function of pressure and temperature, creating Figure 2).
